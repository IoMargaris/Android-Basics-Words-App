# Android-Basics-Words-App (Fragments)

This "activities" branch contains the source code for the Words app but instead of using Intents (see "starter" branch) to navigate through screens it uses fragments.

_*Based on Google's training codelabs (Unit 3: Navigation/Pathway 2)_

I learned the basics of fragments, and converted the Words app to use them. I also learned how to use the Jetpack Navigation component and work with a new resource file called the Navigation Graph to navigate between fragments in the same host activity.
